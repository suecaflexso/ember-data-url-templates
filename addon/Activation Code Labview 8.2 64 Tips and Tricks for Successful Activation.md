## What is an Activation Code?
 
An activation code is a 20-digit alphanumeric code that you can use to activate your NI software without an internet connection. It is generated based on your computer ID, your serial number, and the version of the software installed on your computer. Note that activation codes are unique to the version of the software that they were generated for. For example, an activation code for LabVIEW 8.2 64-bit will not activate LabVIEW 8.6 32-bit or LabVIEW 8.2 32-bit.
 
## How to Create an Activation Code?
 
To create an activation code for LabVIEW 8.2 64-bit, you will need the following information:
 
- Your computer ID: This is a 16-character unique identifier for your computer. You can find it in the NI License Manager utility by selecting the Display Computer ID button or by selecting Display Computer ID in the Options menu.
- Your serial number: This is a nine-digit alphanumeric value located on the Certificate of Ownership, product packing slip, or from the âaboutâ menu of LabVIEW.
- The product version: This is the exact version of LabVIEW 8.2 64-bit that you have installed on your computer. You can find it on the product label, in the product documentation, or in NI License Manager.

Once you have this information, you can follow these steps to generate an activation code:

1. On a computer with an internet connection, visit the [NI Product Activation page](https://www.ni.com/nilg-activate/jsp/customer_activate_details.jsp).
2. Fill out the fields on this page with the information about your offline computer.
3. Click on Generate Activation Code.
4. Copy or write down the activation code that is displayed on the screen.
5. Repeat this process for each software product that you want to activate.

## How to Use an Activation Code?
 
Once you have obtained the activation code(s) for your product(s), you can activate them on your offline computer either through NI License Manager or through the NI Licensing Wizard within LabVIEW. Here are the steps for each method:
