HyperLynx SI/PI/Thermal is a comprehensive solution for pre-layout and post-layout analysis of signal integrity, power integrity, and thermal issues. You can use HyperLynx SI/PI/Thermal to evaluate design tradeoffs, validate designs prior to fabrication, and optimize designs for cost and performance. HyperLynx SI/PI/Thermal supports SerDes channels, DDRx memory interfaces, and general-purpose signal integrity. You can also perform power-aware SI/PI simulation to assess the impact of interactions between the PDN and high-speed signals. HyperLynx SI/PI/Thermal also allows you to model complex flow and thermal fields easily and efficiently with HyperLynx Thermal.
 
HyperLynx DRC is a fast and easy-to-use tool for electrical design verification. It can quickly run complex electrical rules on PCBs to verify corporate and technology-specific rules of thumb. HyperLynx DRC can help you avoid common design errors such as crosstalk, differential pair skew, return path discontinuities, impedance mismatches, and more. HyperLynx DRC can also check for safety and compliance issues such as electrical creepage and clearance. HyperLynx DRC works with any PCB layout tool and does not require any domain expertise.
