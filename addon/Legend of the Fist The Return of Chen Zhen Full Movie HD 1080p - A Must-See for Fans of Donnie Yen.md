Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen is a 2010 martial arts film directed by Andrew Lau and starring Donnie Yen as Chen Zhen, a Chinese hero who fights against the Japanese invasion in 1920s Shanghai. The film is a sequel to the 1994 film Fist of Legend, which starred Jet Li as Chen Zhen.
 
The film follows Chen Zhen's return to Shanghai after fighting in World War I, where he joins a group of patriots who run a newspaper that exposes the Japanese atrocities. Chen Zhen also adopts a masked vigilante persona, inspired by his friend's death and his admiration for The Green Hornet serials, to fight the Japanese and their collaborators in the night. One night, Chen discovers that the Japanese are planning to assassinate General Zeng, the son of a northern warlord, and push the blame to General Zhuo, a rival warlord. Zeng's death will spark off a civil war between the two warlords and aid the subsequent Japanese invasion[^2^].

Chen Zhen must use his skills and courage to stop the Japanese plot and save China from falling into chaos. The film features spectacular action scenes choreographed by Yen himself, as well as a star-studded cast that includes Shu Qi, Anthony Wong, Huang Bo and Yasuaki Kurata.
 
Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen is a thrilling and entertaining film that pays homage to Bruce Lee, who first played Chen Zhen in the 1972 film Fist of Fury. The film also explores the themes of patriotism, identity and sacrifice in a turbulent era of Chinese history.

The film begins with a prologue set in 1917, where Chen Zhen and a group of Chinese laborers are sent to the front lines in France to help the Allied forces. Chen Zhen single-handedly charges into a German machine gun nest and destroys it, saving his comrades. He then finds his friend Qi Tianyuan dying from a gas attack and promises to return his harmonica to his family in Shanghai.
 
Three years later, Chen Zhen arrives in Shanghai under the alias of Qi Tianyuan, using his friend's identity and passport. He is greeted by Liu Yutian, the editor-in-chief of the Shanghai Times, who is also the leader of an underground resistance movement against the Japanese. Liu introduces Chen to his friends and colleagues, including the beautiful nightclub singer Kiki, who is Liu's girlfriend and Chen's love interest.
 
Chen soon learns that Shanghai is under the influence of the Japanese, who have formed an alliance with General Zeng and control the city's economy and politics. Chen also discovers that there is a mole within the resistance who leaks information to the Japanese. Chen decides to join Liu's cause and help expose the Japanese schemes. He also creates a masked alter ego, The Masked Warrior, who wears a black trench coat and a fedora hat with a mask resembling The Green Hornet. The Masked Warrior becomes a symbol of hope and justice for the Chinese people as he fights the Japanese and their henchmen in the streets and rooftops of Shanghai.
