Fm8 Ritma Tallava is a musical genre that originated in the Balkans, especially among the Albanian and Roma communities. It is a fusion of electronic music, folk music, and oriental influences. The name comes from the FM8 software synthesizer, which is used to create the distinctive sounds of the genre, and the word "tallava", which means "dance" in Romani.
 
The genre is popular in countries such as Kosovo, Albania, Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Germany, where many Albanian and Roma immigrants live. It is often played at weddings, parties, and nightclubs. Some of the most famous artists of Fm8 Ritma Tallava are Blerim Krasniqi, DJ Fasko, Elmaz Shkupi, and FaZe\_Aleks069.
