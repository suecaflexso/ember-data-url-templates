Deep Freeze Standard 7.72.020.4535 is a software that can protect your computer from unwanted changes by restoring it to its original state on every restart. It is useful for preventing malware infections, system crashes, or user errors that can damage your system.
 
Deep Freeze works by creating a virtual snapshot of your system configuration and saving it on a hidden partition of your hard drive. When you enable Deep Freeze, any changes you make to your system will be written to this partition instead of your actual system files. When you disable Deep Freeze, you can choose to keep or discard these changes.

To use Deep Freeze, you need to install it on your computer and set up a master password that can activate and deactivate the software. You can also configure some settings such as the frozen drives, the thawed spaces, or the maintenance mode. Once you have done that, you can enable Deep Freeze and enjoy a worry-free computing experience.
 
However, there are some things you need to be aware of when using Deep Freeze. First, you should not forget your master password because there is no way to recover it if you lose it. Second, you should not leave Deep Freeze enabled if you want to make some permanent changes to your system, such as installing new software or updating drivers. Third, you should not uninstall Deep Freeze without disabling it first, otherwise you may encounter some problems.
