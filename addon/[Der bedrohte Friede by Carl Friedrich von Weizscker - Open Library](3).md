## The Main Themes and Arguments of Der bedrohte Friede
 
Der bedrohte Friede is divided into four parts: The First Part deals with the historical background and the current state of the world; The Second Part discusses the challenges and opportunities for peace in the nuclear age; The Third Part explores the ethical and spiritual dimensions of peace; and The Fourth Part outlines von WeizsÃ¤cker's proposals for a new world order.
 
Some of the main themes and arguments of Der bedrohte Friede are:
 
- The world is facing a triple crisis: a military crisis caused by the nuclear arms race and the threat of war; an ecological crisis caused by the overexploitation of natural resources and the pollution of the environment; and an economic crisis caused by the imbalance between rich and poor countries and the instability of the global financial system.
- The root cause of these crises is the uncontrolled capitalism that dominates the world economy and politics. This system is driven by greed, competition, and power, and creates inequality, injustice, and violence. It also prevents any meaningful cooperation among nations and peoples to solve the common problems of humanity.
- The only way to overcome these crises is to create a new world order based on solidarity, democracy, and human rights. This requires a radical transformation of the existing institutions and structures, as well as a change in the values and attitudes of individuals and societies. It also requires a new understanding of peace as not only the absence of war, but also as the presence of justice, freedom, and harmony.
- Peace is not only a political goal, but also a moral duty and a spiritual quest. It demands that we respect the dignity and diversity of all human beings, as well as the integrity and beauty of nature. It also demands that we cultivate our inner peace through self-awareness, compassion, and wisdom.

## The Predictions of Der bedrohte Friede
 
Der bedrohte Friede is not only a book of analysis and reflection, but also a book of prophecy. Von WeizsÃ¤cker made several predictions about the future of the world based on his observation of the trends and tendencies of his time. Some of these predictions have been proven right by history, while others have not yet come true or have been modified by unforeseen events.
