# How to Download I386 Lang Folder for Windows XP SP3
 
If you are using Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3) and you want to run the System File Checker (SFC) tool to repair or replace corrupted system files, you may need to have the I386 Lang folder on your computer. The I386 Lang folder contains the language-specific files for the x86 architecture of Windows XP. Without this folder, SFC may ask you to insert the Windows XP CD with SP3, which you may not have.
