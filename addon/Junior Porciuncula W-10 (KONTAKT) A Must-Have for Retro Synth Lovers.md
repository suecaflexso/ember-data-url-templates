# Review: Junior Porciuncula W-10 (KONTAKT)
 
If you are looking for a library that recreates the classic sounds of the Korg 01/W workstation, you might want to check out the W-10 by Junior Porciuncula. This library is based on the Korg 01/W, a popular synth from the early 90s that featured a wide range of sounds, from pianos and organs to pads and leads.
 
The W-10 library contains 14 patches that cover the most iconic sounds of the Korg 01/W, such as the Universe, M1 Piano, Organ 2, and Brass 1. You can switch between the patches without cutting the audio, and you can also combine them using the superknob. The library also features a memory manager that allows you to reduce the memory consumption by loading only the samples you need.

The library is compatible with Kontakt 5.6 or higher, and it requires about 4.5 GB of disk space. The sound quality is excellent, and the samples are carefully recorded using the mLan16 output (Digital FireWire). The library also includes a custom interface that gives you access to various parameters, such as volume, pan, reverb, chorus, filter, and envelope.
 
The W-10 library is a great option for anyone who wants to add some vintage synth sounds to their productions. The library captures the essence of the Korg 01/W, and it offers a lot of flexibility and control. You can get the library from Junior Porciuncula's Facebook page for $50.
