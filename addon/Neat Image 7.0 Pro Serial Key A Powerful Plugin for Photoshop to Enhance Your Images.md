## How to Use Neat Image 7.0 Pro to Improve Your Photos
 
Neat Image 7.0 Pro is a versatile software that can work as a standalone application or as a plug-in for Photoshop or other compatible applications. You can use it to reduce noise and grain in your photos, whether they are taken in low-light conditions, with high ISO settings, or with old or low-quality cameras.
 
Neat Image 7.0 Pro has a simple and intuitive interface that allows you to adjust the noise reduction settings according to your preferences and needs. You can also use the built-in presets or create your own custom profiles for different types of noise and images.
 
Here are the basic steps to use Neat Image 7.0 Pro to improve your photos:
 
### Step 1: Open Your Photo
 
If you are using Neat Image 7.0 Pro as a standalone application, you can open your photo by clicking on File and then on Open Image. You can also drag and drop your photo into the main window.
 
If you are using Neat Image 7.0 Pro as a plug-in for Photoshop, you can open your photo in Photoshop and then go to Filter and then to Neat Image and then to Reduce Noise.
 
### Step 2: Select a Noise Profile
 
A noise profile is a set of parameters that describes the characteristics of the noise in your photo. Neat Image 7.0 Pro uses this information to apply the optimal noise reduction algorithm.
 
You can select a noise profile in two ways:

- Use an auto profile: Neat Image 7.0 Pro can automatically analyze your photo and select the best noise profile for it. To do this, click on the Auto Profile button and wait for the analysis to finish.
- Use a manual profile: You can manually select a noise profile from the built-in presets or from your own custom profiles. To do this, click on the Device Noise Profile tab and choose a profile from the list.

### Step 3: Adjust the Noise Reduction Settings
 
Once you have selected a noise profile, you can adjust the noise reduction settings to fine-tune the results. You can do this by clicking on the Noise Filter Settings tab and moving the sliders for luminance, chrominance, and sharpening.
 
You can also use the preview window to see how the noise reduction affects your photo. You can zoom in and out, switch between before and after views, and compare different areas of your photo.
 
### Step 4: Apply the Noise Reduction and Save Your Photo
 
When you are satisfied with the noise reduction settings, you can apply them to your photo by clicking on the Apply button.
 
If you are using Neat Image 7.0 Pro as a standalone application, you can save your photo by clicking on File and then on Save As. You can choose the file format, quality, and location of your photo.
 
If you are using Neat Image 7.0 Pro as a plug-in for Photoshop, you can return to Photoshop by clicking on OK. You can then save your photo in Photoshop as usual.
