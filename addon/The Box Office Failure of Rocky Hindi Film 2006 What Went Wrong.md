There Rocky tries to forget his past life. His father lies to him that Anthony has been sentenced to death by the court. Three months later, Rocky's friend Vikram visits them and informs them that Anthony has escaped the trial by killing both the eyewitnesses. Meanwhile, Priya, a tour guide and Rocky's friend, is harassed by some people. When she shouts to Rocky for help, he unlike before, takes a conservative path and walks away. Vikram tells Priya the truth about Rocky's past and why he has changed.
 
On hearing this Rocky feels shattered and wants revenge. He travels back to India along with his parents. Anthony learns that Rocky has returned to Mumbai. He then pays a visit to his home where he encounters Rocky's father. His father tells him to meet Rocky at the same spot where he had killed Neha several months ago. A fight ensues between Rocky and Anthony. At the end, though severely injured, Rocky is about to kill Anthony but Neha's soul stops him from doing so.
