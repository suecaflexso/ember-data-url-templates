## What is a SCUM License Key?
 
A SCUM license key is a unique code that activates the game on your Steam account. You need to enter the key when you install the game or when you launch it for the first time. The key is usually sent to your email address when you buy the game from an authorized retailer or directly from Steam.
 
A SCUM license key can only be used once and by one person. If you try to use a key that has already been activated by someone else, you will get an error message and you will not be able to play the game.

You can use platforms like Steam Trading Cards, Steam Gifts, or Reddit Game Swap to find potential trading partners. However, be careful and make sure that the trade is fair and safe. Do not share your personal information or account details with anyone and do not accept any suspicious links or files.
