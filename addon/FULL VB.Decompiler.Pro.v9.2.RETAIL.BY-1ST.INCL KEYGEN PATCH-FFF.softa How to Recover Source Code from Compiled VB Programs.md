However, you can enable this feature by editing a configuration file of IDA Pro. The file is called idagui.cfg and it is located in the Drive: Program FilesIDA PRO Advanced Editioncfg folder. Open this file with a text editor and search for the line that says DISPLAY\_PATCH\_SUBMENU. This line controls whether the patching options are visible or not. It is usually set to NO, which means they are hidden. To make them visible, change the NO to YES and save the file.

After you have saved the idagui.cfg file, you need to restart the IDA Pro for the changes to take effect. When you open the IDA Pro again, you should see a new submenu called Patch program under the Edit menu. This submenu contains various options for patching or editing the assembly code of the program you are analyzing.
  
Patching the assembly code can be useful for several purposes. For example, you can patch a program to fix a bug, to change its behavior, to bypass a security check, or to add a new feature. However, patching also has some risks and limitations. You need to be careful not to corrupt the program or introduce new errors. You also need to be aware of the legal and ethical implications of modifying someone else's code without their permission.
  
To patch a program, you need to select the instruction or data that you want to modify and choose the appropriate option from the Patch program submenu. You can also use keyboard shortcuts or right-click on the instruction or data and select Patch from the context menu. Depending on what you want to do, you can choose from different types of patching options. For example, you can change bytes, assemble new instructions, fill with NOPs (no operation instructions), undo patches, or apply patches to the input file.

One example of patching a program is to change a conditional jump instruction to an unconditional jump instruction. This can be useful for bypassing a condition that you do not want to meet or that is hard to satisfy. For instance, suppose you have a program that asks you for a password and then jumps to a different location depending on whether the password is correct or not. You can patch the program to always jump to the location where the password is correct, regardless of what you enter.
  
To do this, you need to find the address of the conditional jump instruction in the assembly code. You can use the IDA Pro's search function or navigate manually. Once you have found the instruction, you need to select it and choose Assemble from the Patch program submenu. This will open a dialog box where you can enter a new instruction. You need to enter an unconditional jump instruction with the same destination as the original instruction. For example, if the original instruction was JZ 00401000 (jump if zero flag is set), you can change it to JMP 00401000 (jump unconditionally). Then you need to click OK and apply the patch to the input file.
  
After patching the program, you can run it and see the effect of your modification. You should be able to enter any password and access the program as if you entered the correct one. However, you should also be careful not to break the program's functionality or logic by patching it inappropriately. For example, if you patch a loop condition, you might create an infinite loop that will crash the program.
