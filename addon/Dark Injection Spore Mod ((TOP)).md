If you are a fan of Spore, you might have heard of Darkspore, a spin-off game that was released in 2011 and shut down in 2016. Darkspore was a sci-fi action RPG that used the same creature editor as Spore, but with more parts, abilities, and customization options. Unfortunately, Darkspore is no longer playable, but you can still enjoy some of its features with the Dark Injection Spore Mod.

Dark Injection 9.r is a mod for Spore, which aims to rebuild as much of Darkspore as possible, and to expand the creative opportunities Spore provides through those once presented within Darkspore[^2^]. By installing this mod, you can access:
 
- Over 650 new creature parts (and counting!)
- We lost count of how many new creature skinpaints
- 10 new vehicle parts (and counting!)
- 40 new adventure props (and counting!)
- Infinite Complexity for all editors
- Five user interface reskins to choose from
- Four creature editor backgrounds to choose from
- All features are optional and can be disabled

To use this mod, you need to have Spore Galactic Adventures Patch 5.1 or greater (if game is installed from disks) and ModAPI Launcher Kit 1.1 or greater[^1^]. You also need to download the latest version of Dark Injection from the official website[^1^] or from other sources[^2^]. Then, you need to run the Easy Installer from the ModAPI Launcher folder and select the Dark Injection file. After that, you can launch the game using the ModAPI Launcher and enjoy the mod.
 
If you want to enhance your mod experience even more, you can also check out some other mods that are compatible with Dark Injection, such as Dark Genetics[^3^], which adds more parts, a modified spine, new abilities, new test drive animations, new editors, and so much more; Infinite Colors[^3^], which gives you thousands of more colors than what Spore has to offer; and CamBen Color Pack[^3^], which adds new color options for parts and paint mode.
 
Dark Injection Spore Mod is a great way to revive some of the features of Darkspore and to unleash your creativity in Spore. Whether you want to create realistic creatures, fantasy monsters, sci-fi aliens, or anything in between, this mod will give you the tools and options you need. Have fun!
  
If you are wondering how to use the Dark Injection Spore Mod, here are some tips and tricks to help you get started. First, you need to know how to access the new parts and features. To do that, you need to open the creature editor and click on the Dark Injection button on the top left corner. This will open a menu where you can choose which user interface, editor background, and complexity limit you want to use. You can also toggle some other options, such as hero abilities, asymmetry, and advanced animations.
 
Once you have selected your preferences, you can start creating your creature using the new parts and skinpaints. You will notice that there are many more categories and subcategories of parts than in the original game. Some of the new parts are from Darkspore, while others are custom-made by the mod developers. You can mix and match any parts you want, as long as they fit within the complexity limit. You can also use the paint mode to apply different colors and patterns to your creature.
 
When you are done with your creature, you can test it in the test drive mode. Here, you can see how your creature behaves and interacts with other creatures. You can also use some of the new abilities that are added by the mod, such as fire breath, lightning strike, telekinesis, and more. These abilities are based on the ones from Darkspore, but they have been adapted to work in Spore. You can assign up to four abilities to your creature using the ability editor.
 
If you want to share your creations with other players, you can upload them to the Sporepedia using the share button. You can also download other players' creations that use the Dark Injection Spore Mod and see how they look and work in your game. However, keep in mind that you need to have the mod installed in order to see and use the new parts and features. Otherwise, you will only see placeholder parts or error messages.
