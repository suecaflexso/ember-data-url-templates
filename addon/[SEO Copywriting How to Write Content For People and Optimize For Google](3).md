## Accidente de trÃ¡fico y retirada

The band had to cancel all their upcoming shows and events. Since then, the band has been in a state of hiatus, recovering from their injuries and focusing on their personal lives. The band has not released any new material or announced any future plans. However, they have expressed their gratitude to their fans and their hope to return to music someday.
 
Supersubmarina discografia is a testament to the talent and passion of one of the most influential indie rock bands in Spain. Their songs have touched the hearts of many people and have left a mark on the Spanish musical landscape. We hope that Supersubmarina will overcome this difficult situation and will come back stronger than ever.
