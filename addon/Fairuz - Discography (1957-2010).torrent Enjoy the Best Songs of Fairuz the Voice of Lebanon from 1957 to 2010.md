When she was 14, she auditioned for a music teacher named Mohammed Fleyfel, who was impressed by her voice and recommended her to Halim El Roumi, the head of the Lebanese Radio Station. El Roumi hired her as a chorus singer and gave her the stage name Fairuz, meaning "turquoise" in Arabic. She soon attracted the attention of two brothers, Assi and Mansour Rahbani, who were composers and musicians working at the radio station. They became her mentors and collaborators, and introduced her to a new style of music that blended Arabic classical music with Western influences. Assi Rahbani also became her husband in 1955, and they had four children: Ziad, Layal, Hali and Rima.

She also performed live at various festivals and concerts in Lebanon and abroad, gaining popularity and acclaim. She starred in several musical plays written by the Rahbani brothers, such as Albaalbakiya (1961), Ash'Shakhs (1970), and Jibal As-Sawan (1980). These plays showcased her versatility as a singer and an actress, and featured songs that became classics of Arabic music. Some of her most famous songs include "Aatini al-Nay" ("Give Me the Flute"), "Habbaytak Bissayf" ("I Loved You in Summer"), "Nassam Alayna al-Hawa" ("The Breeze Blew Over Us"), "Ya Tayr" ("Oh Bird"), and "Li Beirut" ("To Beirut").
